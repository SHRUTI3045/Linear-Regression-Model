# Linear Regression Model

A simple Linear Regression model built using Python and Scikit-learn to predict a continuous outcome from input data. This project focuses on understanding the concept of linear regression, training a model, visualizing results, and evaluating performance using standard metrics.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a regression model that predicts outcomes based on input features using the line of best fit, and understand how the model learns, generalizes, and performs.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, metrics)

---

## 📊 Dataset

Used the [Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset) from Scikit-learn or alternatively [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andonians/random-linear-regression).

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Implemented Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Visualized the data and regression line using Matplotlib
- Evaluated the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**
- Interpreted model behavior and insights from results
